Determining whether two strings are identical is (relatively!) trivial: iterate over the characters in each, checking whether each and every one is identical. But itâ€™s non-trivial to quantify just how dissimilar two (non-identical) strings are. And it can be time-consuming, as there are multiple (and often many!) ways to transform one string into the other.

The challenge ahead is to measure the "edit distance" between two strings, the minimal number of additions, deletions, and/or edits necessary to transform one string into the other.
